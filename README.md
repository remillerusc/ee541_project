SVM_KNN_Distances_between_Peaks_as_features.ipynb:

This file has all the code needed to run svm and knn models including preprocessing and feature engineering to get distances between peaks. To run this code, install these libraries: numpy, scipy, pandas,sklearn. Put the Auido_Files folder at the same repository as the code file.

SVM_KNN_Peak_Locations_as_features.ipynb:

This file has all the code needed to run svm and knn models including preprocessing and feature engineering to get locations of peaks. To run this code, install these libraries: numpy, scipy, pandas,sklearn. Put the Auido_Files folder at the same repository as the code file.

EE541_Project_Mobilenet_WAV.ipynb:

This file contains all code needed to run MobileNet V3 (Large) convolutional neural network. The file preprocesses the audio data to Mel spectrograms, performs baseline inference on the pre-trained MobileNet V3 (Large) model, sequentially trains the network, and evaluates the trained model. To run this code, install these libraries: torch, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, sklearn, scipy, torchaudio. Put "/data/" folder in the same reposity as code file.

EE541_Project_Resnet_WAV.ipynb:

This file contains all code needed to run ResNet-34 residual neural network. The file preprocesses the audio data to Mel spectrograms, performs baseline inference on the pre-trained ResNet-34 model, sequentially trains the network, and evaluates the trained model. To run this code, install these libraries: torch, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, sklearn, scipy, torchaudio. Put "/data/" folder in the same reposity as code file.
