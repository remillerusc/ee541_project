SVM_KNN_Distances_between_Peaks_as_features.ipynb:

This file has all the code needed to run svm and knn models including preprocessing and feature engineering to get distances between peaks. To run this code, install these libraries: numpy, scipy, pandas,sklearn. Put the Auido_Files folder at the same repository as the code file.
